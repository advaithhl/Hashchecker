# Hashchecker

*NOTE: Hashchecker is not yet tested or stable, and is not usable as of now.*

### What is Hashchecker?

Hashchecker is a command-line tool to calculate [checksum][0], [verify the integrity][1], and find redundant files. 


### Why Hashchecker?

+ **Hashchecker is fast:** 
Due to its multi-threaded hash-finding, Hashchecker is much more (almost two times) faster than running a bash script to do the same.

+ **Based on pure Python:** 
Hashchecker is based on the python [`hashlib`][2] library, and is thus extremely efficient.

+ **Built to be CLI:**
Hashchecker does not require a sophisticated GUI to get the job done.
Why summon a fancy application, when you can simply open up the terminal and summon Hashchecker in a split of a second? :wink:


### Installation instructions

As I had mentioned above, Hashchecker is not yet ready to be installed. 
You may clone this repo to try the features if you want, but it is clunky, and I will soon add an installation method via pip.
